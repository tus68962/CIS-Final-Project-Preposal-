# CIS-Final
While there was minimal final product to demonstrate, a lot of hours and work went into it. The overall challenge I encountered was learning a new programming language, Lua, on Pico-8. Pico 8 and my Mac OS made it more difficult to debug. For the game itself, I had some troubles with the game physics and most specifically swapping the ingredient sprite for an empty space when the filly collided with it. The screen updates 30 times per second, so the ingredient counter in the satchel got pretty high after the filly collided with the item. I also had a difficult time coding a congratulations screen when the filly got to final pretzel, so instead I just had a jingle play. For the jingle to actually trigger, the filly needed to have at least 20 ingredients in the satchel. Aside from the academic learning, I learned that sometimes I have to swallow my pride and acknowledge that not everything in vision will work out, perseverance conquers but focusing my attention on only one facet can be harmful. After all that, I did enjoy the project. I liked making the landscape and platform adventures for the little filly that I created. I wanted the "story" to be based around a pun: Philomena the Filly (a female foal) getting a pretzel, in the shape of a Philly pretzel.
