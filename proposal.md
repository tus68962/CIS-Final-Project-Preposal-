# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pretzel Pixie (perhaps)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A PICO-8 platformer game/story game where the little pixie gathers the ingredients and delivers a pretzel to people. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software (will hopefully) allow the player to control a pixie to jump, slide/duck, and dash its way through stages. It will feature a satchel that houses the ingredients and possibly an experience counter. It will be executed through an online PICO-8 cartridge. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

n/a

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

n/a

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The baseline would be a short bit for the intro to the story and controls and one complete stage for the pixie to complete. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be around 2 complete and unique stages with an intro and a celebration part. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be 3 or 4 stages. The first small bit would be an intro to the story and controls. The second/third would be collecting the ingredients. The third/fourth would be delivering the pretzel to another character or people, with a celebration at the end. The chance to customize the color scheme of the pixie or character would be awesome. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to more flesh out the story and stages. Then, I need to learn the code/language for PICO-8 games. I also need to see if I need to buy the PICO-8 dev platform that has the bells and whistles or not. I plan to use their tutorials and subreddit for most of the groundwork. It would be smart to look at popular platformers and other PICO-8 games. I will need to play with the game physics and keep in mind the limitations.
